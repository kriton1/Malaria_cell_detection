# Malaria_cell_detection
Malaria has emerged as a major challenge for the global healthcare system and remains a significant cause of death, particularly in underdeveloped countries. To improve malaria detection, researchers, such as Rajaraman et al. in 2018, have explored different methods, including the use of pre-trained convolutional neural networks. They focused on enhancing the detection of malaria parasites in thin blood smear images using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT).

The most commonly employed clinical methods for malaria diagnosis are RDT and microscopic diagnosis. RDT is convenient as it does not require a specialized medical professional, but it has some drawbacks like vulnerability to heat and humidity and higher cost compared to using a light microscope. In contrast, microscopic diagnosis, while free from these limitations, necessitates the expertise of a trained professional.

In recent times, deep learning has garnered significant attention in the medical field, demonstrating successful results in diagnosing diseases like malaria. The main goal is to develop algorithms capable of automatically detecting malaria cells and comparing different models. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model and a fully connected feed-forward neural network have proven to be effective in detecting malaria cell images. These models can adjust the number of parameters without compromising the quality of the results, even when dealing with high-dimensional images. Additionally, these approaches have achieved noteworthy progress in text processing as well.

Overall, the performance of these models has been compared with other approaches using the malaria dataset, showing promising results in malaria cell detection.
